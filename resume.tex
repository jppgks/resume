\begin{cvsection}{Work Experience}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Research Intern}{KU Leuven}{Aug 2018 -- Sep 2018}
		Leuven, Belgium
		\begin{itemize}%
			\item Developed a system that automatically extracts keywords from a textual query (in one of 3 languages) by employing a state-of-the-art universal dependency parser (DRAGNN). These keywords are then used for retrieving relevant video content sourced from citizen journalists.
			\item Combined textual and video signal, we make a multi-modal embedding to enable searching in continuous space for consistent videos, relevant to the search query.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{cvsubsection}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Development Intern}{T-Mining}{Feb 2017 -- Aug 2017}
		Antwerp, Belgium
		\begin{itemize}%
			\item Set up development operations: automated building and testing of 2 Node.js powered apps and 1 blockchain app on CircleCI from BitBucket repositories.
			\item Implemented new geolocation features, using the Ionic mobile app framework. 
			\item Designed and added a new user interface for this mobile application for truck drivers, using Adobe XD. This enabled the startup to demo more of the app that improves security at the physical handover of containers in ports.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{cvsubsection}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Development Intern}{VikingCo}{Jul 2016 -- Sep 2016}
		Hasselt, Belgium
		\begin{itemize}%
			\item Reduced duration of running test suites of the Mobile Vikings web platform by 40\%, so developers lose less time and are encouraged to run tests often.
			\item Added features to \textquotedbl{}Django admin\textquotedbl{}-powered MVP for business support system of new premium app service, which sped up the development of this product.
			\item Implemented feature for existing Mobile Vikings product that enabled the company to generate detailed data about a subset of users and act on that new information.
