\begin{cvsection}{Work Experience}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Research Intern (Machine Learning)}{IBM Research, Z\"urich}{Jul 2019 -- Mar 2020}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Developed AI models to predict chemical actions for a reactor robot to perform in order to synthesize a given organic molecule. At scale, this enables chemists across the world to order a given molecule online, without providing any details about the process to synthesize it.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{cvsubsection}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Associate Scientist Intern}{Procter \& Gamble}{May 2019 -- Jul 2019}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Applied natural language processing techniques to automatically detect and visualize topics of consumer complaints, enabling new topic discovery and trend detection.
			\item Used regular expressions to recover 13\% of noisy data which enabled linking consumer feedback to production information for the first time.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{cvsubsection}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Independent consultant}{Daydream}{May 2019 -- Jul 2019}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Deployed machine learning model as REST API to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, enabling research output to be taken into production.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{cvsubsection}
	\centering\textbf{KU Leuven University}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Research Intern (Machine Learning)}{}{Feb 2019 -- May 2019}
		\begin{itemize}%
			\item Performed research into state-of-the-art natural language processing, more specifically into better document representations for automatically classifying clinical reports (ICD-coding). 
			\item Wrote an ETL pipeline for the MIMIC II \& III dataset using TensorFlow to serve as input to NLP models.
			\item Developed Python software to compare different NLP representations of patient discharge summaries, as well as models for predicting ICD-9 codes from those discharge summaries.
			\item Worked with university hospital UZ Leuven to prepare training of AI models on anonymized patient data using Google Cloud Platform.
			\item Successfully employed the latest developments in artificial intelligence, both in software (BERT, TensorFlow) and in hardware (TPU).

	\begin{cvsubsection}{Teaching Assistant}{}{Sep 2018 -- Dec 2018}
		\begin{itemize}%
			\item Accommodated exercise sessions for the course on Principles of Computer Programming (G0N28A).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{cvsubsection}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Research Intern}{}{Aug 2018 -- Sep 2018}
		\begin{itemize}%
			\item Developed a system that automatically extracts keywords from a textual query (in one of 3 languages) by employing a state-of-the-art universal dependency parser (DRAGNN). These keywords are then used for retrieving relevant video content sourced from citizen journalists.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{cvsubsection}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Development Intern}{T-Mining}{Feb 2017 -- Aug 2017}
		\begin{itemize}%
			\item Set up development operations: automated building and testing of 2 Node.js powered apps and 1 blockchain app on CircleCI from BitBucket repositories.
			\item Implemented new geolocation features, using the Ionic mobile app framework. 
			\item Designed and added a new user interface for this mobile application for truck drivers, using Adobe XD. This enabled the startup to demo more of the app that improves security at the physical handover of containers in ports.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{cvsubsection}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Development Intern}{VikingCo}{Jul 2016 -- Sep 2016}
		\begin{itemize}%
			\item Reduced duration of running test suites of the Mobile Vikings web platform by 40\%, so developers lose less time and are encouraged to run tests often.
			\item Added features to \textquotedbl{}Django admin\textquotedbl{}-powered MVP for business support system of new premium app service, which sped up the development of this product.
			\item Implemented feature for existing Mobile Vikings product that enabled the company to generate detailed data about a subset of users and act on that new information.
